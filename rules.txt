[Start]
- Each player chooses their favorite letter (A-Z).
- If there's a tie, they choose a number to decide the order.
- A sequence order is created to start the game.

[Warm-up]
- Each player starts with 60 points.
- About 20 questions. Players "raise hands" to answer.
- Correct: **+10 points**.
- Incorrect: **-10 points**.
- Referee adds/deducts points.

[Assessment Session]
